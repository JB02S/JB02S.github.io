                I was orignally interested in the trading due to the fact that I wanted to make money over the summer with the money I was making from
                a part-time job. As I began reading about different strategies and indicators etc I thought that surely if I could obtain the right information from indicators 
                which I was using on TV (TradingView), I could use some logic to place a trade for me rather than spending all day staring at a chart.
